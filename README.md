## Abstract

Trading is one of the most important aspects of commerce in human history.To consistently make
profit, traders take every negative or positive trade they make as a learning opportunity. Predicting
and analyzing financial indices has been of interest in the financial community for a long time,
but recently, there has been a wide interest in the Machine Learning community to make use of
and benefit from the more advanced techniques, such as reinforcement learning. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has been able to surpass many of the Machine Learning benchmarks in a lot of
fields. In this project we explore the plausibility of using RL in an algorithmic trading system.
Our approach provides a feature rich environment for the reinforcement learning agent to work
on. Firstly, we use the daily closing prices and volume of bitcoin in the market. As our aim
is to provide long term profits to the user, we took into consideration some of the most reliable
technical indicators. We have also developed a custom indicator to evaluate the current value of
the prices. This aims at providing better insights of the Bitcoin market to the user. The Bitcoin
market follows the emotions of the traders, so another factor of our trading environment was the
overall daily Sentiment Score of the market on Twitter. The agent was tested for a period of
685 days which included the volatile period of Covid-19. It was able to provide recommendations
reliable enough to give an average profit of 69%. Finally, the agent was able to recommend the
optimal actions to the user through a website. The user can also access the visualizations of the
important indicators to help them fortify their decisions.
